# connect-4
this is a command prompt version of the old classic connect 4 board game
can be either 2 players or 1 player vs a computer 


# breaking down on what I need to do:
  - create the board
  - get user input
  - check if the input is a valid place and if the spot has already been taken go a level higher until you can go there
  - check if the new input is the winning case if not switch to the other player 
  - if the game board is full and no winners then its a tie



# checking if a player has won
  - check horizontally 
  - check vertically 
  - check diagonal

# check input validation:
  - need to loop on the current player until they give a valid input. 
  - if the column is filled up make sure they can no longer go there.
